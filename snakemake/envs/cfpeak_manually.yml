to be added: mamba install r-argparse bioconductor-iranges bioconductor-biocgenerics bioconductor-rtracklayer r-data.table 
manually: bioconda has r-bedtoolsr, but require R>=4, in which cfPeak is not fully tested, we recommend install following https://github.com/HUNNNGRY/cfPeak/tree/master
#seems r-base upgrade to 4.0.2 automatically after install
#mamba install ipykernel
#mamba install bamtools=2.5.1
